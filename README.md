# Smart-Home
Arduino Project

This application can be divided into two main systems,

•Night Light Automation System:

•This system automatically turns on the lights at night when someone enters the room.

•An ultrasonic and Servo motor used to detect the motion in a room.

•A photoresistor (LDR) used to detect whether we are during the day or at night.

•LEDs to be turn on at night.

Home Gate Automation System:

•This system is used to allow the homeowner to automatically open the home gate when
the bell rings without having to leave the room.

•Two Switch Buttons were implemented, one for the bell and another one for the
homeowner to open the gate.

•A buzzer to notify the homeowner when the bell rings.
•A DC Motor to open the gate.
